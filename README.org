* Map Art

A proof-of-concept website and server to test whether:

- [[https://github.com/fosskers/mapalgebra][My ~mapalgebra~ library]] works and is at all performant
- Haskell and its [[https://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][Servant]] library are any good for writing tile servers
- [[http://elm-lang.org/][Elm]] is productive for writing real webapps
- The above tools would be sufficient for writing a production-grade webapp for generating Map Art

** Dependencies

- Haskell's [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][stack]] tool
- Elm's [[https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html][suite of tools]]
- ~make~

** Running Locally

| Command      | Result                                          |
|--------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| ~make build~ | Compile both the front and backends             |
| ~make elm~   | Rebuild only the Elm frontend (produces JS)     |
| ~make go~    | Rebuild everything and start the backend server |

If the backend server starts successfully, you should see ~Listening for requests...~
printed to stdout. You can then access the site on [[http://localhost:8081][port 8081]].
